Currently, I'm a Computer Science student at UFRJ, and although I'm discovering more aspects of computing, the world of web development, especially front-end, has my heart. In college, I had the incredible opportunity to be part of a junior company (EJCM) and there I got to know the area of ​​UX/UI Design, areas in which I am very interested and try to learn more every day. I love developing truly user-focused solutions!",
