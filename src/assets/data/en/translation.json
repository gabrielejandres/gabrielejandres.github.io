I also studied Computer Science at UFRJ, and there I had the opportunity to be part of a junior company (EJCM), where I learned about UX/UI Design, areas I'm very interested in and try to learn more about every day. Although I'm discovering more aspects of computing, the world of software development is my favorite. I love developing solutions that are really focused on the user and solving their problems!",
